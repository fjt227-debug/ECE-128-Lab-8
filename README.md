# ECE-128-Lab-8
The objective of Lab 8 is to design and implement RAM and ROM memory components using Verilog. Part 1 of this lab is to create an 8X8 RAM capable of reading and writing 8 bit data at 8 different memory locations. Part 2 of this lab is to create a ROM with 4 bit data width in 8 different memory locations. This lab aims to reinforce the understanding of memory structure, address decoding, and synchronous vs asynchronous behavior. Another objective is to develop testbenches for both modules and verify through simulation waveforms. Overall, this lab strengthens digital design skills by applying theoretical concepts to working memory modules
1.) Compile project: Create 2 .vfiles and copy the RAM.v and ROM.v file 2.) Copy the testbenchs (RAM_TB.v file and ROM_TB.v file) and input under simulation sources 3.) Run Simulation to get output waveforms
